There should be 5 txt files in total after running the program and two java programs, whose name is token.java and comp.java.

"README" is a simple instruction about the programming and input and output text.
"labelled-token" txt is put under the file to let this program read data from this txt documentaty.
“dict” txt is put under the file to compare the output one with the standard "dict" documentary.
"result3" is the output txt for trigram(n=3) and change n=2 in token.java, the output "result2"txt will for bigram.

token.java aims to compute the cost between two strings and find the minimum cost for each string in "labelled-tokens", 
       the getDistance method is created refers to http://jimmee.iteye.com/blog/2077233.
compare.java aims to compare the number of exact correct token and the not exact correct token in all these source tokens.
